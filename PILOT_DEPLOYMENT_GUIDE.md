   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Set main file: `streamlit_app.py`
   - Choose Python version: 3.9+

2. **Configure Secrets** (Critical for Security)
   ```toml
   [auth]
   staff_password = "YF_Staff_P@ssw0rd_2024!"
   admin_password = "YF_Admin_Secure_Key_2024#"
   manager_password = "YF_Manager_Access_2024$"

   [app]
   environment = "production"
   debug_mode = false
   max_results_limit = 15
   rate_limit_queries_per_minute = 20

   [monitoring]
   enable_analytics = true

admin_password = "YF_4dmin_Pr0d_K3y#2024"
manager_password = "YF_M@nager_Access$2024"
```

#### 2. Production Environment Variables
```toml
[app]
environment = "production"      # Disables debug features
debug_mode = false             # Hides error details from users
max_results_limit = 15         # Limits search results
