Yetifoam is chemically compatible with PVC cables. EPS polystyrene is the problem material that causes induced plasticizer migration from PVC covering, which can degrade the cables over time. Do you have a specific project you were enquiring about? If you reach out via the below link one of our team members will be happy to discuss it with you. Electrical - Rewiring Great question! Underfloor wiring is installed at least 50 mm below the floor to avoid being punctured when fixings are put through the floor. Our standard 30 mm application may leave a little overspray, but cables aren’t encased—so unlike batts, there’s no need to remove, rewire, or reinstall them.

Independent testing confirms YetiFoam can reduce energy bills by 30–60% annually by sealing air leaks and eliminating heat loss. Learn more or get a free quote here: https://yetifoam.com.au/contact/ Is it better than batts? Yes—unlike batts, YetiFoam eliminates gaps, sagging, and air movement, maintaining full thermal performance for life. Batts can lose up to 59% due to poor fit, compression, and moisture. 28/08/2025, 10:27Yetifoam Meta Comment Responses - Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jKap5C8CDp4bfN7xXVdYvB7g2MzIfDsP-utNoCsZnE/edit?tab=t.05/8 Is it better than batts #2 Great question! There are several key reasons why Yetifoam underfloor insulation outperforms traditional batts : Installation: ● Just a 5% gap in batt installation can result in a 50% decrease in thermal performance ● In suspended floors, it's practically impossible to install batts perfectly in every gap, crack, and crevice ● Batts cannot properly seal around services, pipes, wiring, and junction points ● These gaps create thermal bridges and air pathways that dramatically reduce effectiveness Why Batts Fail Over Time: ● Sagging - Gravity causes batts to fall away from the underfloor over time ● Pest Damage - Highly susceptible to rodent damage, nesting, and displacement ● Moisture Degradation - Lose effectiveness when compressed or wet ● Air Permeability - Allow air to pass through the material itself, losing significant thermal performance in the process ● Real-World Performance - A New Zealand study found that batts lose at least 27% of their stated R-value as soon as they're opened and installed Why Yetifoam is a Superior Solution: ● Complete Air Seal - Expands to fill 100% of gaps, cracks, and penetrations as an air-barrier ● Permanent Adhesion - Bonds directly to surfaces, eliminating sagging forever ● Moisture Resistance - Acts as a moisture and vapour barrier that repels water and maintains performance ● Pest Proof - Solid barrier prevents rodent entry and nesting ● Consistent Performance - Maintains full R-value for the life 28/08/2025, 10:27Yetifoam Meta Comment Responses - Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jKap5C8CDp4bfN7xXVdYvB7g2MzIfDsP-utNoCsZnE/edit?tab=t.06/8 of the building and never needs to be replaced ● Structural Enhancement - Adds rigidity and strength to floor systems and eliminates cracks in timber floors The bottom line: While Yetifoam is applied thinner, it delivers superior real-world performance that saves you money year after year. Yetifoam's advanced technology creates a complete thermal envelope that traditional batts simply can't match, resulting in a warmer, drier, more comfortable home with significantly lower energy bills. Where is YetiFoam made? YetiFoam is proudly made in Dandenong, Victoria, specifically for Australian conditions and building standards.

YetiFoam takes those qualities even further, tailored for Victorian homes and conditions. 28/08/2025, 10:27Yetifoam Meta Comment Responses - Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jKap5C8CDp4bfN7xXVdYvB7g2MzIfDsP-utNoCsZnE/edit?tab=t.07/8 Can you do internal Walls We don’t, sorry—your best option for existing internal walls would be a blow-in cellulose product - there are many installers around Melbourne - Enviroflex would be the largest. Internal Water Leaks - Negative Comment In a hypothetical scenario where all waterproofing in internal wet areas—bathrooms, laundries, kitchen sink zones—has failed: Admittedly, YetiFoam hasn’t been tested in a situation like this, as we specialise in retrofits and waterproofing defects are almost always identified shortly after construction. What YetiFoam has been tested—and proven—to do is create a seamless underfloor barrier against ground moisture and vapour, which is a far more common cause of timber rot and long-term damage to floor structures over the life of a building. Trap Moisture #2 Hi! No, there’s no risk of that at all—in fact, quite the opposite. Every YetiFoam job includes strict pre- and post-installation checks to ensure compliance not only with It’s not just our specifically engineered formula that allows us to offer the only Lifetime Performance Guarantee in the industry—it’s also our detailed reporting, documentation, and specialised application methods.

As long as you don’t mind waiting, then yes!” **Ducting installed underfloor** > “Depending on the clearance we can – we can also remove them if required and then reseal the penetrations with YetiFoam, which seals the duct off much better than duct tape.” **Pipes and electrical wires under the house** > “We don’t spray them, but they are fine and it has never been an issue. We do cover copper pipes where possible as this helps with hot water. Remember – the pipes and wires in your walls are also surrounded in insulation.” **Doubling workload by needing less than 400mm** > “You’re right! We’ve been working on a solution that should be available in time for next winter. We’ll keep everyone posted.” **Regional service – Mildura** > “We service Mildura—please lodge an enquiry via the link below and our team will be in touch. > https://yetifoam.com.au/contact/” **Beach/coastal environments & mice** > “YetiFoam has a closed-cell structure making it ideal for coastal homes because it doesn’t absorb moisture, resists salt air and sand, and seals tightly under your floor. It’s also a strong deterrent to mice and rats, as it permanently blocks off their pathways, is too dense to chew, and unlike batts is not a nesting material. YetiFoam also comes with a lifetime performance guarantee.” **Condensation & heaters (sales script)** > “In homes with suspended timber floors, heaters work overtime because of all the unwanted air coming in at the wall and floor junctions. That extra warm air holds more moisture and when it hits cold windows, condensation forms. YetiFoam seals off those gaps, reducing heater use – and that’s why our customers say the condensation disappears.” **Passive heating explained** > (Your layman’s script version explaining that the sun warms the house naturally if designed right, and insulation like YetiFoam helps keep that heat in – this wording isn’t in the doc.) **services properties throughout Victoria, Australia.” **General pushbacks list items** - Several of your pushback handling answers (e.g., BAL29, tiled roofs, underfloor wiring clearance, mice/rats, condensation, recyclable insulation, ducting, etc.) were scattered across chats but not compiled into the doc.
